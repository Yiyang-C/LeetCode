# 456. 132 Pattern
## Medium
### Stack
#

Given an array of ```n``` integers ```nums```, a **132 pattern** is a subsequence of three integers ```nums[i], nums[j]``` and ```nums[k]``` such that ```i < j < k``` and ```nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]```.

Return ```true``` if there is a **132 pattern** in ```nums```, otherwise, return ```false```.

**Follow up**: The ```O(n^2)``` is trivial, could you come up with the ```O(n logn)``` or the ```O(n)``` solution?

Example1:
> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
> 
> Output: false
>
> Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.

Example2:
> Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].

Example3:
> Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
> 
> Output: true
>
> Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

**Constraints:** 
* ```n == nums.length```
* ```1 <= n <= 10^4```
* ```-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9```

**My Note:**
* Using stack to store the increasing number as pattern '3' in '132'
* Using ```pat2``` to store the possible value of pattern '2' in '132'
* If a certain number is lagger than the number at the top of the stack
* Pop the stack and store it in ```pat2```
* If a certain number is smaller than ```pat2``` we can conclude there is an '132 pattern'

Solution1:
*Time: O(n)*
*Space: O(n)*
```python
class Solution:
    def find132pattern(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return False
        pat2 = -float('inf')
        s = []
        for i in range(len(nums))[::-1]:
            if nums[i] < pat2:
                return True
            while s and nums[i] > s[-1]:
                pat2 = s.pop()
            s.append(nums[i])
        return False
```
