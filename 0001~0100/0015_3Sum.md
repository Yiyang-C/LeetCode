Given an array ```nums``` of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in ```nums``` such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example1:
> Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
> 
> Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]

Example2:
> Input: nums = []
> 
> Output: []

Example3:
> Input: nums = [0]
> 
> Output: []

**Constraints:** 
* ```0 <= nums.length <= 3000```
* ```-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5```

<details><summary>Hint1</summary>
So, we essentially need to find three numbers x, y, and z such that they add up to the given value. If we fix one of the numbers say x, we are left with the two-sum problem at hand!

<details><summary>Hint2</summary>
For the two-sum problem, if we fix one of the numbers, say
<br>x
<br>, we have to scan the entire array to find the next number
<br>y
<br>which is
<br>value - x
<br>where value is the input parameter. Can we change our array somehow so that this search becomes faster?
</details>
<br>
<details><summary>Hint3</summary>
The second train of thought for two-sum is, without changing the array, can we use additional space somehow? Like maybe a hash map to speed up the search?

**My Note:**
* Sort ```nums```
* Iterate the num in nums to find triples sum up to 0

Solution:
*Time: O(n^2)*
*Space: O(1)*
```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        
        if len(nums) < 3:
            return res
        
        nums.sort()
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue
            l, r = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            while l < r:
                total = nums[i] + nums[l] + nums[r]
                if not total:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[l], nums[r]])
                    l += 1
                    r -= 1
                    while l < r and nums[l] == nums[l-1]:
                        l += 1
                    while l < r and nums[r] == nums[r+1]:
                        r -= 1
                elif total < 0:
                    l += 1
                else:
                    r -= 1
        return res
```
